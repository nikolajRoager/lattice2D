6x6 Lattice with 3 particles for 36 sites
Generating and printing ALL legal states to stderr
Found 7140 states


 Now creating hermitian hamiltonian (7140 by  7140)
Has Ï†=0.24

 Now diagonalizing hamiltonian...

 ... Done, here are the 3 lowest energies and eigenvectors
E_0=-8.09624
Total particle density is 3
All test PASSED, is valid eigenstate and eigenvalue

E_1=-7.97756
Total particle density is 3
All test PASSED, is valid eigenstate and eigenvalue

E_2=-7.93247
Total particle density is 3
All test PASSED, is valid eigenstate and eigenvalue
